# Extraction of publicly accessible respiratory virus surveillance data 

Governments of many countries collect high quality surveillance data on respiratory illness. Here I provide a collection of code to extract and tidy respiratory surveillance data which is publicly accessible for the following countries:

- [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/surveillance/respiratory-virus-detections-canada.html)

- United States of America: [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm), [NREVSS](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html) and [ILINet](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html).
